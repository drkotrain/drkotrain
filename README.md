This is Dr Kotrain. I used to be a Web developer and now an instructor in a STEM workshop. I interest in creating small robots, cyberdeck, simple electronic project and Web tools.

Okay... I also interest in computer music, photography, poetry, etc, simply because every part of us connects to each other.
